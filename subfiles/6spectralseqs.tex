In what follows, we fix an abelian group $A$. We will freely use the theory and results of \autoref{(co)algebra}

\begin{definition}
    An \emph{$A$-graded spectral sequence} is the data of a collection of $A$-graded abelian groups $\{E_r^*\}_{r\ge r_0}$ along with homomorphisms of $A$-graded abelian groups (possibly of nonzero degree) $d_r:E_r\to E_r$ such that $d_r\circ d_r=0$ and $E_{r+1}=\ker d_r/\mathrm{im}\,d_r$.
\end{definition}
