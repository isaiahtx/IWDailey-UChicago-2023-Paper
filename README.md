This document is a _draft_.

We develop an axiomatizatic generalization of the classical, motivic, and equivariant stable homotopy categories. In this general setting we: explore graded anticommutativity properties of stable homotopy rings,  develop a notion of cellularity, prove an analogue of the K\"unneth theorem and the universal coefficient theorem, and construct a version of the dual $E$-Steenrod algebra and formulate the precise in which sense it is a graded anticommutative Hopf algebroid. All of our work will culminate in the construction of a (homological) $E$-Adams spectral sequence, and we characterize its $E_2$ page in terms of $\Ext$ of comodules over the dual $E$-Steenrod algebra.
